# Prompt: Refactor Code

Use this when code needs cleanup, splitting, or safer structure without changing user-visible behavior.

```text
Refactor the target code while preserving existing behavior.

Before editing:
1. Read AGENTS.md and the smallest relevant rules from .agent-context/rules/.
2. Inspect the real repo conventions before introducing a new structure.
3. If required project docs are missing, stop and bootstrap or update docs first.
4. If the change touches UI, load .agent-context/prompts/bootstrap-design.md and .agent-context/rules/frontend-architecture.md before editing.
5. If the change touches a dependency, framework, Docker, runtime, or ecosystem claim, verify current official docs before choosing.
6. Enforce Universal SOP hard gate: stop implementation if `docs/architecture-decision-record.md` is missing, and for UI scope stop if `docs/DESIGN.md` or `docs/design-intent.json` is missing.
7. Enforce backend universal principles: no clever hacks, no premature abstraction, readability over brevity.

Refactor rules:
- Improve clarity, boundaries, naming, validation, error handling, tests, and docs.
- Prioritize maintainability over compressed one-liners.
- Do not choose a stack, framework, library, or topology from offline assumptions.
- Keep module boundaries explicit and project-specific.
- Split large files when the split makes the flow easier to understand.
- Do not introduce abstractions before the repeated pattern is real.
- Update tests and docs whenever behavior contracts, public APIs, data shape, or UI contracts change.

For every meaningful change, explain:
- what risk or friction existed
- what changed
- why the new shape is safer or easier to maintain
```
